<!--START-->

At a very young age boy are instructed that boy’s don’t cry. Once it began, it comes at all angles: family, friends, teachers, culture and the myriad voices of the media. Male tears were shown as less masculine. such beliefs were beaten in males from a early age. Growing up in a rough neighbourhood usually represses men from showing how they feel as this can be seen as a sign or weakness which could make them an easy target.

Our society perpetuates the idea that women are sensitive creatures. We are in touch with our emotions. We’re able to express ourselves and tell others when we’re sad or angry. We have no problems crying. In fact, women and girls are encouraged to cry if the occasion permits. Cry, let it out, it’s OK to cry, I’ve been told over and over again.

Little boys, on the other hand, are often told to “stop crying” from a young age. There is a societal expectation for boys to display toughness. If you can’t remember the last time you cried, that’s a problem. That means that you’re repressing genuine emotions.



Cultural 

As men, we like to think of ourselves as strong and in control of our emotions. When we feel hopeless or overwhelmed by despair we often deny it or try to cover it up. But depression is a common problem that affects many of us at some point in our lives.

Many men do not recognize, acknowledge, or seek help for their depression. They may be reluctant to talk about how they are feeling. But depression is a real and treatable illness. It can affect any man at any age. With the right treatment, most men with depression can get better and gain back their interest in work, family, and hobbies.
